Description: Print Quota/Accounting system for CUPS
 PyKota is a full featured, internationalized, centralized and extensible 
 Print Quota system for CUPS. It supports both PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite and 
 OpenLDAP (or other LDAP servers) as the quota database backend
 .
 This package is build an modified for use in linux-musterloesung 
 .
 This software features most of what you might expect from a modern Print 
 Quota and Accounting Solution. However it can be extended at will 
 because it allows one to plug his own administrative scripts at
 several stages of the printing process.
