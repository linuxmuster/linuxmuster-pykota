>    Whenever a user tries to print a document, if he is over his print quota,
    then the job is refused. Depending on <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PyKota</SPAN
>'s
    configuration, especially the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>mailto</TT
> option, he and/or
    the administrator may eventually receive an email message which explains
    the situation and invites him to solve the problem before being allowed
    to print again.
  </P
><P
>    However this may not be sufficient, and you may want to warn users who
    have reached their print quota at
    regular intervals, like every day, for example from a <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>cron</SPAN
> job.
  </P
><P
>    This may be useful if the user has reached his print quota, and have received an email message telling him so,
    but then he doesn't print for some days and may forget to fix the problem, by buying more
    paper for example.
  </P
><P
>    The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>warnpykota</B
> command was written with this in mind. 
    If you put this command in your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>crontab</TT
>, launching it for example
    every day, then you'll be sure that all your users who are above their print quota
    will not forget it ! Of course they may delete the messages without having read them,
    but at least they won't be able to say that they didn't receive them ;-)
  </P
><P
>    When an user who is not a <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PyKota</SPAN
> administrator launches this command, only him can receive a warning
    message. He can specify a printer name's filter to check his quota only
    on specific printers. If a normal user uses the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>--groups</TT
> command line
    argument, then for each group he is a member of in the print quota database, each
    group member may receive a warning message. You can take care of this if this
    becomes annoying by forbidding normal users to launch the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>warnpykota</B
>
    command.
  </P
><P
>    <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PyKota</SPAN
> administrators can pass additionnal user or group names 
    (or wildcard filters) to only check the users or groups whose name matches.
